    <p>CSCW Doctoral Consortium will be held virtually on October 23, 2022.</p>

<h2 id="important-dates">IMPORTANT DATES</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Friday, June 24, 2022</strong>: Deadline for doctoral consortium submission.</li>
  <li><strong>Friday, August 5, 2022</strong>: Notification of acceptance.</li>
  <li><strong>Monday, August 15, 2022</strong>: Final camera-ready versions of overview and posters due</li>
  <li><strong>Sunday, October 23, 2022</strong>: Doctoral Consortium, held virtually at CSCW 2022.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="call-for-participation">CALL FOR PARTICIPATION</h2>

<p>The CSCW 2022 Doctoral Consortium (DC) provides an opportunity for doctoral students to discuss their research in an international forum under the guidance of a panel of experienced CSCW researchers. The DC will be held virtually on October 23 as part of the ACM 2022 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing. Successful applicants will be expected to give short, informal presentations of their work and participate in discussions with other students and with mentors in a friendly and constructive workshop environment. Participants will also provide an interactive poster for the main technical program of the conference, outlining the purpose and contribution of the work they are engaged in.</p>

<p>The overall goals of the DC are to provide PhD students at a relatively advanced stage of their work with feedback and guidance on their current and future research directions and to develop a supportive network of junior CSCW scholars.</p>

<p>We welcome applicants from a broad range of disciplines and approaches that inform CSCW, including anthropology, sociology, information science, computer science, cognitive science, organizational studies, design and related fields. Possible topics include, but are in no way restricted to, the design and/or evaluation of software; studies of social media use; studies of new environments of technology use (e.g., makerspaces, Industry 4.0); and issues of sustainability, development and marginalization. We are particularly interested in applications from institutions and groups that have not traditionally been well-represented at past CSCW conferences.</p>

<p>Applicants should be Ph.D. students with an already established direction of research relevant to CSCW, but whose research would benefit from guidance provided by peers and senior colleagues at the Doctoral Consortium. Preference will be given to students who have a defined topic and program of work, i.e., who have proposed their topics and are within 2 years of graduation within a 5-year program or are approximately halfway through a 3 (or 4) year program.</p>

<h2 id="submission-guidelines">SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h2>

<p>Doctoral Consortium submissions must be uploaded online at the Precision Conference System (select CSCW 2022 Doctoral Consortium from the “Track” drop down menu) to be considered. All items below should be collated into one PDF file named [YOURNAME]_CSCWDC2022.pdf (substitute your full name where it reads YOURNAME):</p>

<ul>
  <li>An abstract (150-250 words) describing your dissertation research.</li>
  <li>A 4–6-page overview (including references) of your doctoral research that describes, at minimum, your research question(s), work in progress, and expected contributions. Your overview will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed to all attendees as part of the Conference Extended Abstracts. Please submit your application in the <a href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow">ACM Master Article Template</a>.</li>
  <li>A list of 3-5 keywords that best describe your research.</li>
  <li>A short biographical sketch, including a paragraph articulating what you hope to gain from attending the CSCW Doctoral Consortium.</li>
  <li>Availability of funds to attend the Consortium (e.g., complete funds available through the university/research grant, partial funds available, preparing an application for the SIGCHI Student Travel Grant, applied for a travel grant but was not awarded, etc.). See below under “Important Note on Funding.”</li>
  <li>A two-page CV.</li>
  <li>Optional: A link to one publication that best illustrates your research interest and/or one paper/book that you find most inspiring (e.g., something you draw on to inform your work, or something that pushed your research in a given direction)</li>
  <li>A letter from your supervisor is also required and should be emailed to <a href="mailto:dc2022@cscw.acm.org">dc2022@cscw.acm.org</a>. The letter should indicate that they support your application to the Consortium, and they agree that your research is at an appropriate stage for participation. The letter should also make reference to how you might benefit from the Doctoral Consortium and how they expect that you might benefit the other students in this group experience. The email should have “<strong>CSCW DC: YOUR NAME”</strong> in the subject header.</li>
</ul>

<p>All submissions must be uploaded to PCS by <strong>23:59 AoE on Friday, June 24, 2022</strong>. Submissions received after this date will not be considered. Submissions will be acknowledged by email once they have been checked for completeness. All questions should be directed to <a href="mailto:dc2022@cscw.acm.org">dc2022@cscw.acm.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-funding-and-format">NOTES ON FUNDING AND FORMAT</h2>

<p>We are hoping to offer financial support to a limited number of Doctoral Consortium participants by covering CSCW registration costs. Currently, there is considerable uncertainly with regard to funding possibilities and we strongly encourage all prospective applicants (domestic and international) to seek the funding required for their virtual attendance.</p>

<p>The ultimate format of the Doctoral Consortium will be finalized in the months leading up to the conference. We expect it to include some synchronous sessions with the full group, as well as provision for breakout sessions and asynchronous feedback where suitable. We will be attentive to difficulties associated with different time zones. If you have suggestions for ways to encourage networking or building relationships, please send them to us when you submit your application or in a separate email.</p>
