  <li><strong>Thursday, August 4, 2022</strong>: Camera-ready submissions due</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="about-demonstrations">ABOUT DEMONSTRATIONS</h2>
<p>CSCW 2022 Demonstrations present implementations of new CSCW systems and concepts. The curated demonstrations allow conference participants to view novel and noteworthy CSCW systems in action, discuss the systems with those who created them, and try them out. Appropriate demonstrations include applications, technologies, and research prototypes, and may showcase work that has been or is being published at CSCW or elsewhere. Demonstrations can also serve to showcase novel commercial products not previously described in the research literature.</p>

<p>Compelling demonstrations can include (but are not limited to) the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-user interactions with large displays</li>
  <li>Hardware and tangible devices that have the potential for novel cooperative interactions</li>
  <li>Augmented or immersive environments</li>
  <li>Novel social networking systems</li>
  <li>Design interventions in MOOCs or other large learning environments</li>
  <li>Visualizations of collaborative and social workflows</li>
  <li>Crowdsourcing, community-sourcing, or crowdfunding demonstrations</li>
  <li>Chatbot and conversational agent systems supporting multi-user scenarios</li>
  <li>AI-based systems as partners in collaboration with individual user, teams, or communities</li>
</ul>

<p>As CSCW will be virtual in 2022, demo presenters will be presenting their demos virtually. The exact format of the demo session is still being determined. There will be some form of synchronous video sessions where presenters can give demonstrations with live systems or with pre-recorded video and explain the novel contributions of the systems.</p>

<p>CSCW demos are non-archival. We encourage the submission of demos that were previously shown at other venues but that will be novel to the CSCW audience, as such demos can serve to build bridges between research communities. Authors should state previous demo venues in their submission and point out differences to previous demos.</p>

<p>All questions about Demos should be directed to <a href="demos2022@cscw.acm.org">demos2022@cscw.acm.org</a>
All demonstrations will be advertised and showcased throughout the conference. In addition, a panel of judges will select one demonstration to receive a Best Demo Award during the reception.</p>

<h2 id="submission-materials">SUBMISSION MATERIALS</h2>
<p>Demonstration submissions consist of three required components.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A maximum 6-page extended abstract (required) – will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed to all attendees</li>
  <li>A 2-minute video figure of the system in action that helps illustrate the proposed demonstration (required) – will also be published in the ACM Digital Library</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="extended-abstract">Extended Abstract</h3>
<p>The extended abstract is a description of the project goal or research problem, contribution, and value to CSCW attendees. The maximum length is 6 pages, including references and figures. It will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed to all attendees as part of the Conference Extended Abstracts. 
The extended abstract details the kind(s) of cooperative activities the demonstration is intended to support, the noteworthy and distinguishing ideas or approaches it embodies, a brief description of the system that will be demoed, and a clear statement of the demo’s relevance to the CSCW audience. The extended abstract should be submitted in PDF format. Please use the standard (single-column) ACM submission template (<a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx">Word</a>, <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip">LaTeX</a>, <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf">Overleaf</a>).</p>

<h3 id="system-summary">System Summary</h3>
<p>The demo system summary is a short description of the demo, the team, and the required setup. The system summaries will not be published in the ACM Digital Library. In a separate document, please include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information about the presenter(s), including their relationship to the project.</li>
  <li>Please note if this is a demo of a system described in a CSCW paper accepted at this year’s conference or that has appeared at a past CSCW conference. There’s nothing wrong with this, but it’s useful for us to know. If the system has been demonstrated before, describe if there are any changes for the proposed CSCW demo.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-figure">Video Figure</h3>
<p>The demo submission must be supported by a short Video Figure. The video should be at most two minutes long. A week before the CSCW conference, this video will be uploaded to CSCW’s websites and will be accessible to the public. Please submit a URL for accessing and downloading the video together with the System Summary document instead of sending the video file by email.</p>

<h2 id="submission-instructions">SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<p>All submission materials must be submitted electronically to PCS <a href="http://new.precisionconference.com/">http://new.precisionconference.com/</a> before the submission deadline.
Please direct all questions regarding the demo submissions to <a href="mailto:demos2022@cscw.acm.org">demos2022@cscw.acm.org</a>. We look forward to seeing you!</p>
