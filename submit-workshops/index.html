    <p>CSCW 2022 Workshops will be held virtually on October 22 and 23, 2022. We invite workshop proposals from all areas of research related to CSCW and social computing.</p>

<h2 id="important-dates">IMPORTANT DATES</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Friday, June 24, 2022</strong>: Deadline for workshop proposals.</li>
  <li><strong>Friday, August 5, 2022</strong>: Notification of acceptance. Workshop organizers should begin recruiting participants immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>Monday, August 15, 2022</strong>: Final camera-ready workshop abstracts, workshop descriptions, and website links due.</li>
  <li><strong>Friday, October 7, 2022</strong>: Workshop organizers must notify Workshop Chairs with final workshop attendance numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Saturday/Sunday, October 22/23, 2022</strong>: Workshops take place virtually at CSCW 2022.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="proposal-submission-requirements">PROPOSAL SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<p>Workshop proposals should consist of both an abstract and a detailed proposal. The abstract should be no more than 200 words. The body of the proposal should be no more than 3000 words, and should include a description of the theme(s) of the workshop, the workshop activities and goals, the duration of the workshop (one or two full days), the background of the organizer(s), the maximum number of participants, the means of recruiting and selecting participants, and the equipment and supplies needed to run the workshop. We expect workshop organizers to host the workshops on their own videoconferencing platforms. Proposals should specify the technology and tools that will be used to conduct the workshop in a virtual space. Proposals should also describe the timing and format of the workshops, and how the organizers are planning to accommodate participants from different time zones, with special attention paid to accommodating participants in Asia to encourage participation.<br />
This year, we will be using The ACM Publication System (TAPS) process; all workshop proposals should follow the instructions and use the Word/LaTeX Master Article templates located <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow">here</a>. As you will see in the template, all proposals should be single column format. We recommend reviewing successful workshop proposals from last year to get a sense of what topics were already recently covered and how authors thought about designing their workshops for a virtual environment.</p>

<p>Workshop proposals should be submitted via Precision Conference Solutions (PCS) by <strong>Friday, June 24, 2022</strong>. To submit, please use the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com">https://new.precisionconference.com</a> (Please make sure that you are in the CSCW workshop track when submitting.)</p>

<p>Organizers will be notified about whether their workshop has been accepted on <strong>Friday, August 5, 2022</strong>. Accepted workshops will need to provide a short description of the workshop for publication on the conference website containing the workshop title, names and affiliations of organizers, 200-word abstract, workshop website link, and position paper submission or other participation requirements. The due date for the workshop description and workshop website link is <strong>Monday, August 15, 2022.</strong></p>

<p>A final workshop description will be published in the ACM Digital Library and will be distributed to all conference attendees in the Conference Proceedings Companion. This workshop description should use the Word/Latex templates located <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow">here</a>, and must be submitted by <strong>Monday, August 15, 2022.</strong></p>

<p>Organizers should complete the recruitment process and submit a final headcount to the workshop organizers by <strong>Friday, October 7, 2022.</strong>
Questions concerning proposals should be directed to the CSCW 2021 Workshop Co-Chairs via email: <a href="workshops2022@cscw.acm.org">workshops2022@cscw.acm.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-accessibility">WORKSHOP ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
<p>We encourage proposal submissions to review the ACM’s references for organizing accessible conferences (e.g., <a href="https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/">SIGACCESS’s Accessible Conference Guide</a>). The CSCW 2022 Equity and Accessibility Co-Chairs (Jean Hardy and Kate Ringland) are working closely with this year’s Workshop Co-Chairs in welcoming questions, feedback, or guidance related to making workshops accessible. If questions related to accessibility arise, please direct them to equity2022@cscw.acm.org.</p>
