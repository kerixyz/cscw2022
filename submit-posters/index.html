<h2 id="call-for-participation">CALL FOR PARTICIPATION</h2>
<p>Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions. Posters are an opportunity to describe new work or work that is still in progress, and will be more lightly reviewed than full papers. The presentation of a poster has been key for engaging provocative discussions at CSCW.</p>

<p>Submissions can include, but are not limited to late-breaking and preliminary results, smaller results not suitable for a full or short paper, contributions by collaborative (inter-)national research projects, innovative ideas not yet validated through user studies, early student research, and other research best presented in an interactive forum.</p>

<p>As CSCW will be online for 2022, the poster sessions will take place as a virtual exhibition with the opportunities for both synchronous and asynchronous interactions in interactive virtual spaces. This may include the creation of videos, depending on the final format that is decided by the conference committee.</p>

<h2 id="poster-submission-requirements">POSTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<p>Poster submissions should be between 3-5 pages, including all figures but excluding references, in one of the ACM Primary Article Templates (Note: we are no longer using an extended abstract format):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx">Microsoft Word for Windows</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/enhanced_word_templates/MAC_2011/mac_2011.zip">Microsoft Word Mac 2011</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/enhanced_word_templates/MAC_2016/mac_2016.zip">Microsoft Word Mac 2016</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip">LaTeX (Use sample-manuscript.tex for submissions)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf">Overleaf (or search for ACM Conference Proceedings “Master” Template)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Please submit the 3-5 page manuscript in PDF format. The submission should include author names (not anonymous submission). Note that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>References do not count against the page-limit, and</li>
  <li>We recommend that authors remove the CCS concepts, keywords, and ACM Reference Format (the self-citation) from the first page.</li>
</ol>

<p>Poster abstract submissions must be uploaded online at the Precision Conference System (select CSCW 2022 Posters from the “Track” drop down menu) to be considered. All attachments must be less than 5MB.
If you have questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact the Posters Co-chairs at <a href="posters2022@cscw.acm.org">posters2022@cscw.acm.org</a></p>

<h2 id="poster-authoring-tips">POSTER AUTHORING TIPS</h2>
<p>Accepted Interactive Poster abstracts will be published in ACM Digital Library and distributed to conference attendees as part of the Conference Companion. Here are some suggestions to make strong submissions to the Poster program. 
State the contribution and originality of your work clearly and explicitly: What is the problem? How does your approach help? Why is it better than other available approaches?
Focus on the contribution of your work rather than the background, including just enough background to make clear how your work differs from significant prior research.</p>

<p>Note: Interactive posters abstracts may be chosen based on either the significance of the problem or the originality of your approach. Submissions will be reviewed by the Poster selection committee and/or external reviewers.</p>

<h2 id="designing-your-poster">DESIGNING YOUR “POSTER”</h2>
<p>Accepted poster submissions will be presented in some kind of interactive way. We will update this section with additional tips and details, once the platform for interactive poster participation is selected. No matter what platform is chosen, the goal will be to provide interesting opportunities for interacting with the “posters” and the poster presenters. This may include a 1-page of posters and/or pre-recorded video.</p>

<h2 id="poster-accessibility">POSTER ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
<p>Virtual Considerations for Accessibility: We encourage poster authors to review the ACM’s many references for organizing accessible conferences (e.g., <a href="https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/">SIGACCESS’s Accessible Conference Guide</a>). The CSCW 2022 Equity and Accessibility Co-Chairs (Jean Hardy and Kate Ringland) are working closely with this year’s Poster Co-Chairs in welcoming questions, feedback, or guidance related to making posters abstracts accessible for the ACM Digital Library. If questions related to accessibility arise, please direct them to <a href="mailto:equity2022@cscw.acm.org">equity2022@cscw.acm.org</a>.</p>
